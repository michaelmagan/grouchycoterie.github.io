Personal propulsion includes, walking, biking, scooters, roller skates, and electronic version of those items. I think a motorcycle might also be included by this definition, but in general I am referring to lower speed, sub 30 MPH.

What will change? In the last thirty years batteries have significantly improved making motorized version of the above more pervasive. You can buy fairly affordable motorized bicycles, scooters, and skateboards. This will likely continue to get better maybe even motorized roller skates!

A major improvement could include wireless electricity transfer. This may be used for electronic cars but another benefit might be that roads equipped with this could also power motorized bicycles, skates, etc. Since these items no longer will need batteries they will be much lighter and cheaper. Since batteries account for a large portion of both cost and weight.

It may lead to revolution in commuting. People will opt for cheaper forms transportation than a large vehicle to go shorter distances.
