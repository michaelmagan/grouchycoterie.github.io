I don't think there will be major changes to GPS per se, but I think the future we will be even more dependent on GPS. When I was young we used maps and major innovation was map quest, where it would print out directions ahead of time.

Then personal sized GPS became more available via Tom Tom or embedded in cars. Then mobile phones brought a free GPS into everyone's hands.

I expect that by 2050, watches, glasses, embedded computer directly interfacing your senses or brain, will bring GPS direction into further parts of your life, biking, walking, navigating airports and malls.

In the future finding your way around will be primarily through technology.
