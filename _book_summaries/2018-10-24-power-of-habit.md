I recommned this book to anyone interested in human behaviour, leadership and the science of self-improvement. It lays out clearly how habits work, for individuals and collectives, and how to take advantage of the power of habits. The stories and science are intersting and woven together incredibly well. It was very interesting to read. Lots of practical applications and circumstances you can use. It's not so much how to guids as a pop-science look into habits.
