I really enjoyed this book. It really enlightened me to what is evidence based vs. myth in exercise science, diet and nutrition. As well as, inspiring me to keep training hard for all the medical benefits. The majority of the book focused on the positive health benefits of exercise, but it also had a clear warning  of the negative effects of inactivity.
