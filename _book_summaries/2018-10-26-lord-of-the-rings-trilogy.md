I was very excited to listen to all of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on our last cross-country road trip. They were one of my favorite movies growing up and I had never quite finished the whole series, unsurprisingly since its so long. Tolkien paints a rich world of fantasy with deep thought. If you listen to the audiobook I recommend Rob Inglis. He has the best voices. One thing I never really realized when reading the book was the number of songs. I often skipped them or read them quickly. In the audiobooks, they are sung. We got a good laugh out of them, particularly, “Tom Bomb-Bombadillo”. Who is conveniently left out of the movies.
