A very good summary of how Amazon started with a focus on the founder Jeff Bezos. It's written by a long time journalist who covered Amazon on its rise to global prominence. I learned a lot about how Amazon worked inside and it provided a lot of insight into the culture of the company and how it evolved over time.

It was a fair portrayal of the Amazon story. Stone was willing to point out the good, the bad and ugly of Amazon. Its ruthless focus on the customer. It's pension for disruption of the status quo. It's willingness to use every advantage to further its mission.

Some biographers get too detailed. As I reader, I don't need to know every single detail about someones life, just the broad strokes. Stone included just the right amount of detail.
