We should spend more time *in deep work*. The author provides compelling reasons we should dedicate more time and effort to working deeply. Then provides strategies to find the time, willpower, and endurance to work deeply as much as possible. I found it both interesting and very practical. Anyone in the knowledge econonmy should read this book and start applying where they can.
