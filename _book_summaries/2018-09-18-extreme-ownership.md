Extereme Ownership is leadership principles from navy seals. In the high pressure enviroment of being a seal leadership is a critical element of success. This book was exteremly practical going over examples of the lesson both in combat and the business world. The disciplines that they expose are useful even in the casual enviroments of the modern technical workers. In my detailed summary, I apply these lessons to product development teams.
